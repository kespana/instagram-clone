# Oldagram (Instagram Clone)

A solo project from the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack).  
Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project recreates the look and feel of an Instagram-style feed featuring classic self-portraits by artists such as Van Gogh, Courbet, and De Creux.
